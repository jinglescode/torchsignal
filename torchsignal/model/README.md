# Models

## Multitask Model

Using multi-task learning to capture signals simultaneously from the fovea efficiently and the neighboring targets in the peripheral vision generate a visual response map. A calibration-free user-independent solution, desirable for clinical diagnostics. A stepping stone for an objective assessment of glaucoma patientsâ€™ visual field.

```
model = Multitask_Model(num_channel=10,
    num_classes=40,
    signal_length=1000,
    filters_n1=4,
    kernel_window_ssvep=59,
    kernel_window=19,
    conv_3_dilation=4,
    conv_4_dilation=4,
)

x = torch.ones((20, 10, 1000))
print("Input shape:", x.shape)
y = model(x)
print("Output shape:", y.shape)
